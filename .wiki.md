# Project Summary
The Sevak Mini Tractor project aims to develop a web-based control interface for an electric, autonomous mini tractor designed for rural areas in India. This tractor can perform tasks such as cutting fodder, loading it into a trailer, and transporting it to livestock areas. The control interface will enable users to monitor and control the tractor, schedule operations, and manage various functionalities through a responsive and user-friendly web application.

# Project Module Description
- **Product Requirement Document (PRD)**: Outlines key features and user stories for the control interface.
- **System Design Document**: Details the architecture, data structures, and API specifications.
- **Web Application**: Built using React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, it includes components for dashboard views, control panels, operational status displays, and scheduling features.
