## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 Requirements Analysis
The Sevak mini tractor control interface must address several key technical challenges:

1. **Connectivity Constraints**: Rural India faces significant internet connectivity challenges with inconsistent coverage and bandwidth limitations. The interface must function effectively in low-connectivity environments.

2. **User Accessibility**: The interface must accommodate varying levels of digital literacy and education among rural farmers, prioritizing visual communication and simplified interactions.

3. **Device Compatibility**: Many rural users may access the interface through older smartphones or shared devices, requiring optimization for a wide range of screen sizes and processing capabilities.

4. **Safety Controls**: Remote operation of agricultural machinery presents safety risks that must be mitigated through fail-safe mechanisms, emergency stops, and clear status indicators.

5. **Security Requirements**: The system must implement appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access while remaining accessible to legitimate users with limited technical knowledge.

6. **Operational Efficiency**: The interface must allow for efficient scheduling and management of autonomous operations to maximize battery life and tractor productivity.
