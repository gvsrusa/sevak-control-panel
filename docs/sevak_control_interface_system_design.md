   - Optimize for low-bandwidth areas with minimal data transfer

2. **User Accessibility**
   - Visual-first interface with minimal text
   - Support for Hindi and regional languages
   - Large touch targets for ease of use on various devices
   - Voice command capabilities for users with limited literacy

3. **Safety Controls**
   - Persistent emergency stop functionality
   - Automatic fail-safe mechanisms when connection is lost
   - Clear visual status indicators
   - Confirmation dialogs for critical operations

## Data Structures and Interfaces

The system is organized into several key modules that handle different aspects of tractor control, monitoring, scheduling, and user management. The complete class diagram is available in `sevak_control_interface_class_diagram.mermaid`.

Key data structures and their relationships include:

1. **User Management**
   - `User`: Core user entity with authentication and profile details
   - `UserPreferences`: Personalization settings including language, notifications

2. **Tractor Control System**
   - `TractorController`: Handles direct control commands to the tractor
   - `TractorStatus`: Current state of the tractor including battery, location, operations
   - `Location`: Position data with boundary validation capabilities
   - `Boundary`: Defines operational areas with geofencing capabilities

3. **Task Management**
   - `Task`: Individual operations with scheduling information
   - `Schedule`: Collection of tasks with management functions

4. **Communication Layer**
   - `CommunicationManager`: Handles data transfer between app and tractor
   - `OfflineManager`: Manages operations during connectivity loss

5. **Supporting Modules**
   - `MapManager`: Handles geographical visualization and offline maps
   - `NotificationManager`: User alerts and status updates
   - `Diagnostics`: System health monitoring and alerts
   - `Analytics`: Usage tracking and efficiency calculations
   - `WeatherService`: Weather data integration

## Program Call Flow

The program call flow is detailed in `sevak_control_interface_sequence_diagram.mermaid`, illustrating key operations such as:

1. User authentication flow
2. Initial status load and display
3. Manual tractor control operations
4. Start/stop operational modes (cutting, loading, transport)
5. Emergency stop procedure
6. Task scheduling and execution
7. Handling connection loss/restoration scenarios

## Offline Functionality Design

### Local Storage Strategy
- Essential configuration and user preferences stored in localStorage
- Complex operational data stored in IndexedDB
- Cached map tiles for offline navigation
- Prioritization system for data synchronization when connection restored

### Command Queueing
- Non-critical commands queued in OfflineManager when offline
- Critical commands (e.g., emergency stop) operate on local failsafe logic
- Commands synced based on timestamp and priority when connection restored
- Visual indicators for queued commands vs. executed commands

### Safety Mechanisms
- Automatic speed reduction when operating offline
- Restricted operational area when in offline mode
- Periodic automatic stops to check for connection restoration
- Limited task complexity when offline (simple movements only)

## UI Wireframes

   - Geofencing for operational boundaries
   - Audit logging of all control commands

4. **Physical Security**
   - Remote locking capability
   - Unauthorized movement alerts
   - Operator verification before critical operations

## Deployment Architecture

The system will use a hybrid approach optimized for rural connectivity:

1. **Client Side**

   - Efficient data synchronization for offline mode
   - Optimized map tile management

3. **Future Extensibility**
   - Modular architecture for adding new operations
   - API versioning for backward compatibility
   - Plugin system for third-party integrations

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Hardware Specifications**: The PRD focuses on the web interface but lacks details about the tractor's hardware capabilities and limitations. More information would help optimize the control interface.

2. **Connectivity Requirements**: While the design accommodates offline functionality, clearer specifications on minimum connectivity requirements would help refine the offline/online transition behavior.

3. **Safety Certification Requirements**: What specific safety standards or certifications must the control interface meet for agricultural automation in India?

4. **User Training Approach**: The system design includes a visual-first interface, but a comprehensive training strategy for first-time users would be beneficial.

5. **Battery Management**: More details on battery charging infrastructure would help develop optimal scheduling around battery constraints.

6. **Integration Points**: Clarification on whether the system should integrate with existing farm management software would inform API design decisions.

7. **Data Ownership**: Policies regarding data collection, storage, and ownership should be clarified for privacy considerations.
